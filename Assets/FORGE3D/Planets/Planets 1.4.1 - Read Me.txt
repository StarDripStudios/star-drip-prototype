**FORGE3D PLANETS v1.4**

Thank you for purchasing Planets!

> Where should I start?

Start by looking into the Demoscene level located in the root of Planets folder. You should be able to drag and drop any prefab from the Planets folder and that will work with the all the lights you have in the scene. 
Don't forget to check Window->Lighting->Settings in the editor, and setup your reflection probes.

> How do I add effects?

> How to fix Shader CustomEditor warning?

 | Could not create a custom UI for the shader 'FORGE3D/Planets HD/##Some shader##'. The shader has the following: 'CustomEditor = ASEMaterialInspector'. Does the custom editor specified include its namespace? And does the class either derive from ShaderGUI or MaterialEditor?

This warning is completely harmless, which means you don't have Amplify Shader Editor installed. To fix the warning, please comment this line at the end of shader file (Assets/FORGE3D/Planets/Shaders/*):

// CustomEditor "ASEMaterialInspector"
